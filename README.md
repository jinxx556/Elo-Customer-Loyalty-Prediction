# Elo-Customer-Loyalty-Prediction
## Abstract  Customer loyalty has been an issue that attracts significant attention from credit card companies for a long time. Through providing customer transaction data with loyalty score as target value, Elo, one of the largest credit card company in Brazil, expected to achieve understanding towards customer behavior and insights on maintaining current customers. In this study, important features that influenced customer loyalty score were investigated. After that, target values (customer loyalty score) were modeled using the following parametric and non-parametric methods: Generalized Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Separate models were developed for outliers in the target and ensemble predictions were created by joining outcomes from outlier models and non-outlier models. Results indicated that extreme gradient boosting outperformed other models, while modeling outliers separately did not improve prediction accuracy.
